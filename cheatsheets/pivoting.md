## SSH

### Local Port Forwarding
```
ssh -N -L [bind_address]:port:host:hostport [username@address]
```

### Remote Port Forwarding
- connect back to us and forward a local port to a remote address on our attacking machine
```
ssh -N -R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport [username@address]
```

### Dynamic Port Forwarding
- needs proxychains
- typically can only use bind shells through this proxy
```
ssh -N -D <address to bind to>:<port to bind to> <username>@<SSH server address>
```

## Chisel

### server
```sh
./chisel_linux server --port 9000 --reverse
```

### client
```sh
.\chisel64.exe client 10.10.14.1:9000 R:<remote-port-receiving>:127.0.0.1:<local-port-to-forward>
```
